      <div class = "main-container-column-1">Offbeat, nautically themed American concept on a houseboat, specializing in seafood & burgers. Local approved and Food Network certified, we are happy to welcome all anglers and visitors in for a cold beer and a fresh plate of seafood cooked up Oceanside style. It is our pleasure to share with you the special experience of fresh sustainable seafood cooked just right, in a beautiful, hospitable atmosphere like nowhere else besides here on the Ocean.</div> 
      <div class="main-container-column-2">I started the Oceanside Fish Fry in 2012 as just an idea, a boat, and a desire to see if people would like my food. Would customers like the way I seasoned and prepared food? Would they come to a house boat to eat? Shortly after opening, I would be selected by the Food Network as one of the Top 16 Cooks in America, and the Cooking Channel called me a trend-setter on the modern food scene. Five television food shows, and three major hurricanes later, we are still here on the water introducing customers to our way of life.</div>
